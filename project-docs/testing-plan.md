# TrueCred Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for the TrueCred project, ensuring quality at each development phase.

## Testing Approach

### Types of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**

   - Individual components tested in isolation
   - Smart contract function testing
   - API endpoint testing
   - React component testing

2. **Integration Testing**

   - Testing interactions between components
   - Backend-blockchain integration
   - Frontend-backend API integration
   - Database integration

3. **End-to-End Testing**

   - Complete user journey testing
   - Full credential lifecycle
   - Experience verification workflow
   - Cross-platform compatibility

4. **Performance Testing**

   - Load testing for high transaction volumes
   - Response time benchmarking
   - Database query optimization
   - Blockchain gas optimization

5. **Security Testing**
   - Authentication/authorization testing
   - Smart contract vulnerability analysis
   - API security testing
   - Data validation testing
