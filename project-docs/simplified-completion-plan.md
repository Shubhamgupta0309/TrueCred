# TrueCred Simplified Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the essential components to complete the TrueCred project with a focus on core functionality.

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication (Completed âœ“)

- User registration with email verification
- Login with email/password
- Wallet authentication
- Role-based access control

### 2. Credential System (Priority)

- Credential issuance by authorized institutions
- Credential verification by third parties
- Credential revocation
- Secure credential storage

### 3. Experience Verification (Secondary)

- Experience record creation
- Verification by employers
- Experience endorsement

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Clean and Consolidate (1 Week)

- Remove unnecessary files and folders
- Consolidate backend folders
- Organize project structure
- Document existing functionality

### Phase 2: Smart Contract Development (2 Weeks)

- Create TrueCred.sol with core functions:
  ```solidity
  // Core functions only
  function issueCredential(address to, bytes32 hash) external returns (uint256);
  function verifyCredential(uint256 id) external;
  function revokeCredential(uint256 id) external;
  ```
- Deploy to test network
- Create simple contract interaction tests

### Phase 3: Backend Integration (2 Weeks)

- Connect backend to smart contract
- Create credential API endpoints:
  ```
  POST /api/credentials
  GET /api/credentials/:id
  POST /api/credentials/:id/verify
  POST /api/credentials/:id/revoke
  ```
- Implement basic IPFS or hash storage
- Set up credential database models

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (2 Weeks)

- Create credential components:
  - Credential card
  - Issuance form
  - Verification display
- Build dashboard views:
  - User credential view
  - Issuer dashboard
  - Verifier interface
- Implement blockchain transaction UI

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (1 Week)

- End-to-end testing of core workflows
- Bug fixing and optimization
- Security review
- User experience improvements

## Development Approach

1. **Minimal Viable Product**

   - Focus on core credential functionality
   - Limit scope to essential features
   - Prioritize working features over completeness

2. **Iterative Development**

   - Complete one feature before moving to the next
   - Test each component as it's developed
   - Regular integration tests

3. **Documentation First**
   - Document the design before implementation
   - Create API specifications before coding
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation

## Team Focus Areas

### Kirti (Blockchain Developer)

- Focus solely on TrueCred.sol development
- Create simple deployment scripts
- Document contract interaction patterns

### Shubham (Backend Developer)

- Build essential API endpoints
- Connect blockchain and database
- Implement credential verification logic

### Saniya (Frontend Developer)

- Create core credential components
- Build essential dashboard views
- Implement wallet connection UI

## Testing Strategy

1. **Contract Testing**

   - Unit tests for each contract function
   - Deployment tests on test networks

2. **API Testing**

   - Endpoint functionality tests
   - Authentication tests
   - Error handling tests

3. **UI Testing**
   - Component rendering tests
   - User flow tests
   - Cross-browser compatibility

## Timeline

Week 1: Project cleanup and planning
Week 2-3: Smart contract development
Week 4-5: Backend integration
Week 6-7: Frontend development
Week 8: Testing and refinement

## Deployment Plan

1. **Development**

   - Local Ganache blockchain
   - Local backend server
   - Vite dev server

2. **Testing**

   - Ethereum testnet (Sepolia)
   - Test environment for backend
   - Staging deployment for frontend

3. **Production**
   - Ethereum mainnet (or selected L2)
   - Production backend with proper security
   - Production frontend with CDN
