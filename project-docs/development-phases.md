# TrueCred Development Phases

This document outlines the development phases for the TrueCred project, dividing work among team members and ensuring each phase delivers testable components.

## Phase 0: Folder Consolidation (Immediate)

**Action Items:**

1. Move any unique contract files from `truecred-backend/contracts` to `backend/contracts`
2. Delete the `truecred-backend` folder after confirming all content is preserved
3. Update repository references to use only the `backend` folder

### Saniya (Frontend):

- [x] Implement advanced filtering and search for credentials
- [x] Create data visualization for credential analytics
- [x] Improve responsive design and UI/UX
- [x] Implement advanced form validation

### Testing Milestones:

- [x] Performance testing for high transaction volumes
- [x] Stress testing database and blockchain operations
- [x] Cross-browser and device compatibility
- [x] Security audit and vulnerability testing

## Phase 5: Final Integration & Testing (1-2 Weeks)

**Focus:** Final integration of all components, comprehensive testing, and preparation for deployment.

### All Team Members:

- [x] Comprehensive end-to-end testing
- [x] Bug fixing and refinement
- [x] Documentation completion
- [x] Preparation for production deployment

### Testing Milestones:

- [x] Security vulnerability assessment
- [x] Performance benchmarking

## Collaboration Schedule

### Weekly Integration Points:

1. **Monday**: Team sync meeting to discuss weekly goals
2. **Wednesday**: Mid-week integration check to resolve blocking issues
3. **Friday**: End-of-week demo and testing session

### Bi-Weekly Deep Integration:

1. **Contract-Backend Integration**: Kirti & Shubham ensure Web3 interfaces match contract functions
2. **Backend-Frontend Integration**: Shubham & Saniya test API endpoints and data flow
3. **Full System Testing**: All team members test complete user journeys
