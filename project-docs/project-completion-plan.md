# TrueCred Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to complete the TrueCred project, with **Truffle-based blockchain integration** as the core approach from the start.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality with Truffle Integration

### 1. User Authentication & Profile System

**Complete student profile with education info**

Backend:

- Implement `User` model with embedded `Education` documents and validation (institution, degree, field_of_study, start_date, end_date if not current).
- Add/verify `/api/user/profile` PUT endpoint to save education array and set `profile_completed` when valid.

Frontend:

- Profile page form for education entries (institution, degree, field_of_study, start_date, end_date, current).
- Client-side validation matching backend.
- On save, show "Profile complete" badge if valid.

**Student credential request flow**

Backend:

- Implement `/api/credentials/request` POST endpoint to persist credential requests with attachments (status: pending, issued, rejected).
- Store attachments as `verified:false` for student uploads.
- Add notification on request creation.
- **Truffle Integration**: Store credential request hash on blockchain for immutability.

Frontend:

- StudentDashboard: "Upload New Credential" action opens form, uploads file to IPFS, then creates request.
- Show "Pending Requests" and "Issued Credentials" panels.
- **Blockchain Status**: Show blockchain transaction status for each request.

**Issuer credential issuance flow**

Backend:

- `/api/organization/upload-credential/<student_id>` POST endpoint accepts request_id, creates authoritative credential, marks request as issued, adds notification.
- **Truffle Integration**: Deploy credential to blockchain with issuer signature and IPFS hash.

Frontend:

- CollegeDashboard/CompanyDashboard: list pending requests, allow issuer to view, reject, or issue (upload authoritative file).
- **Blockchain Integration**: Show blockchain deployment status and transaction links.

**Notifications**

Backend:

- Insert notification documents for request creation and status changes.
- **Blockchain Events**: Listen for blockchain events and create notifications.

Frontend:

- Notification panel polls `/api/notifications` and displays updates.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for blockchain event notifications.

**Acceptance criteria checklist**

## File Structure Cleanup

**Keep Only Essential Files:**

- `/backend/services/` - Core services (remove blockchain_service.py if not needed)
- `/backend/truffle/` - **NEW**: Truffle smart contract development
- `/frontend/src/` - React application
- `/frontend/src/services/api.js` - API integration
- `/frontend/src/pages/` - Core pages (CollegeDashboard, StudentDashboard, etc.)

**Remove Unnecessary Files:**

- Old blockchain integration files (contracts/, build/ in root)
- Unused scripts and test files
- Duplicate or outdated documentation
- Development artifacts not needed for production

**New Truffle-Based Workflow:**

1. Develop smart contracts in `/backend/truffle/`
