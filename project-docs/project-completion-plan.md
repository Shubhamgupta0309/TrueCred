# TrueCred Project Completion Plan

This document outlines the phased approach to complete the TrueCred project, with blockchain integration as the final step.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality Completion

### 1. User Authentication & Profile System

- **Complete student profile with education info**

  - Ensure education data is properly saved to MongoDB
  - Add validation for education entries
  - Implement profile completion indicators

  Policy decision (attachments): Students may attach supporting documents when requesting a credential, but those attachments are stored and shown as "unverified" until an issuer (college or company) reviews and uploads the authoritative document to IPFS and issues the credential on-chain. This keeps the issuance authoritative while allowing students to provide helpful supporting files.

  One-day implementation checklist (high priority)

  - Convert student-side "Upload New Credential" to a "Request Credential" flow that calls `/api/credentials/request` and stores any attached files as unverified attachments.
  - Update `StudentDashboard` to show two sections: "Pending Requests" (student requests waiting for issuer action) and "Issued Credentials" (verified from issuer/blockchain).
  - Ensure issuer dashboards (`CollegeDashboard`, `CompanyDashboard`) surface incoming credential requests and include `StudentCredentialUpload` for issuers to upload authoritative documents and finalize issuance.
  - Backend: make sure `/api/credentials/request` persists requests and attachments with a status flag (`pending`/`issued`/`rejected`) and that `/api/organization/upload-credential/<student_id>` requires issuer auth and creates the final credential and issues it on-chain.
  - Add a small notification entry when a request is made and when an issuer issues/rejects a request so students get immediate feedback.
  - Run a quick manual smoke test: student creates a request, issuer approves and issues, student sees credential in "Issued Credentials".

- **Finalize college/institution profiles**
  - Complete organization profile management
  - Add verification status for institutions
- **Company user profile management**
  - Complete company profile setup
  - Add industry categorization

### 2. Credential Management System

- **Complete credential request flow**
  - Students can request credentials from institutions
  - Request includes degree, year, program details
  - Notification system for pending requests
- **Credential verification flow**
  - Institutions can review and approve/reject credential requests
  - Add comments/feedback on rejection
  - Generate credential certificates

### 3. Experience Verification

- **Student experience submission**
  - Allow students to add work experiences
  - Connect experiences to companies in system
- **Company verification flow**
  - Companies can verify student work experiences
  - Add verification status indicators

### 4. Search and Discovery

- **Enhance institution search**
  - Improve search functionality with filters
  - Add pagination and sorting
- **Student directory for institutions**
  - Allow institutions to browse affiliated students
  - Filter students by program/year

### 5. Notification System

- **Real-time notifications**
  - Alert users about request status changes
  - System notifications for important events
- **Email notifications**
  - Send email confirmations for important actions
  - Reminder emails for pending actions

## Phase 2: Integration and Advanced Features

### 1. Document Management

- **Secure document upload**
  - Support for uploading degree certificates
  - Transcript and other educational document handling
- **Document verification**
  - Manual verification of uploaded documents
  - Flagging system for suspicious documents

### 2. API Enhancement and Security

- **Complete API documentation**
  - Document all endpoints with examples
  - Create Postman collection for testing
- **API security enhancements**
  - Rate limiting
  - Input validation
  - Security headers

### 3. Frontend Polish

- **UI/UX improvements**
  - Consistent styling across all pages
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - Accessibility compliance
- **Performance optimization**
  - Code splitting and lazy loading
  - Caching strategies

## Phase 3: Blockchain Integration

At this stage, blockchain functionality will be integrated to provide immutable verification of credentials:

### 1. Credential Issuance

- **Store credential hashes on blockchain**
  - When institutions issue verified credentials
  - Link blockchain transaction ID to credential in database
- **Integration points**:
  - After credential approval by institution
  - Connect to frontend when institution finalizes credential

### 2. Credential Verification

- **Verify credential authenticity via blockchain**
  - Compare hash from blockchain with generated hash
  - Show blockchain verification status
- **Integration points**:
  - When companies/third parties verify credentials
  - When students share credentials

### 3. IPFS Document Storage

- **Store credential documents on IPFS**
  - Upload signed certificates to IPFS
  - Store IPFS hash in blockchain transaction
- **Integration points**:
  - During final credential issuance
  - When documents are generated for sharing

### 4. Smart Contract Integration

- **Deploy verification smart contracts**
  - Automate verification logic on blockchain
  - Enable trustless verification
- **Integration points**:
  - Connect with frontend verification requests
  - Link to credential status updates

## Final Phase: Testing and Deployment

### 1. Comprehensive Testing

- **Unit and integration testing**
  - Test all API endpoints
  - Test frontend components
- **Blockchain-specific testing**
  - Test credential issuance on blockchain
  - Verify document retrieval from IPFS

### 2. Security Audit

- **Penetration testing**
  - Find and fix security vulnerabilities
  - Test authentication system
- **Smart contract audit**
  - Review blockchain interaction security
  - Check for common smart contract vulnerabilities

### 3. Deployment

- **Staging environment setup**
  - Deploy to staging for final testing
  - Test with real blockchain networks (testnet)
- **Production deployment**
  - Deploy backend API
  - Deploy frontend application
  - Deploy and verify smart contracts

## Blockchain Connection Points Summary

The blockchain integration will primarily connect at these points:

1. **After credential verification by institutions**

   - Store credential hash on blockchain
   - Link credential to blockchain transaction

2. **During credential sharing/verification**

   - Verify credential hash against blockchain
   - Show verification status with blockchain proof

3. **When documents are generated/shared**

   - Store documents on IPFS
   - Link IPFS hashes to blockchain records

4. **During experience verification**
   - Companies verify work experience
   - Experience verification stored on blockchain

By completing the core functionality first, we establish a solid foundation before adding the blockchain integration. This approach reduces complexity during development and ensures the basic system works before adding the blockchain layer.
