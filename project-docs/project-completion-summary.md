## Repository Cleanup

As part of the final phase, the following cleanup actions were taken:

1. Consolidated all backend code from `truecred-backend` to `backend` folder
2. Removed duplicate folders and files:
   - `truecred-backend` folder
   - `temp_backup` folder
   - Duplicate blockchain-integration-summary.md in root directory
3. Created a backup of all removed files for reference
4. Validated that all functionality works correctly after cleanup
