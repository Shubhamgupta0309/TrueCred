# TrueCred Project Cleanup and Completion Plan

## Phase 1: Project Cleanup

### 1. Backend Cleanup

**Files/Folders to Remove:**

- `truecred-backend/` (entire folder after preserving any valuable contracts)
- `backend/backup-existing/` (obsolete backups)
- Redundant test scripts (keep only structured tests in `tests/` folder)
- Duplicate setup scripts (keep one version of each setup script)
- Unused or experimental Python files

**Consolidation Actions:**

- Move all contract files to `backend/contracts/`
- Organize tests into proper test modules
- Standardize configuration files

### 2. Frontend Cleanup

**Files/Folders to Remove:**

- Unused component files
- Duplicate or obsolete CSS files
- Test files that are not part of a structured test suite
- Old versions of components or pages

**Consolidation Actions:**

- Organize components by feature/function
- Standardize styling approach
- Consolidate utility functions

### 3. Documentation Cleanup

**Files/Folders to Remove:**

- Outdated or redundant documentation
- Draft documents
- Temporary notes
- Conflicting design documents

**Consolidation Actions:**

- Create structured documentation in `project-docs/` folder
- Maintain a single source of truth for requirements and specifications

## Phase 2: Project Structure

After cleanup, the project should have this simplified structure:

```
TrueCred/
├── backend/
│   ├── contracts/       # Smart contracts
│   ├── db/              # Database scripts and models
│   ├── models/          # Data models
│   ├── routes/          # API endpoints
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   ├── tests/           # Test suites
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── app.py           # Main application
│   └── requirements.txt # Dependencies

│   │   ├── pages/       # Page components
│   │   ├── services/    # API services
│   │   └── utils/       # Utility functions
│   ├── package.json     # Dependencies
│   └── vite.config.js   # Build configuration
└── project-docs/        # Project documentation
```

## Phase 3: Core Development Plan

Once the project is cleaned up, we'll focus on completing these essential features:

### 1. Authentication System

- Email verification ✓
- Wallet connection ✓
- Password reset flow

### 2. Credential System

- Smart contract for credentials
- Credential issuance
- Credential verification
- Credential revocation

### 3. User Interfaces

- User dashboard
- Issuer dashboard
- Verifier dashboard

### 4. Blockchain Integration

- Transaction handling
- Document hashing
- Verification proofs

## Implementation Plan

We'll implement the project in these sequential stages:

1. **Complete Authentication** (1 week)

   - Finalize email verification
   - Add password reset
   - Polish wallet authentication

2. **Implement Smart Contracts** (2 weeks)

   - Develop core credential contract
   - Create test suite
   - Deploy to test network

3. **Build Credential APIs** (2 weeks)

   - Create credential CRUD endpoints
   - Implement verification endpoints
   - Connect to blockchain

4. **Develop UI Components** (2 weeks)

   - Build credential components
   - Create dashboard views
   - Implement verification UI

5. **Final Integration** (1 week)
   - Connect all components
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization

This simplified approach focuses on delivering the core functionality with minimal unnecessary code.
